Hi, I work as an AI agent Engineer.  
I keep lightweight notes on insights and experiments from real work.

Outside of work, I enjoy traveling and reading, and I often get ideas from new experiences.  
I plan to share posts that blend tech and everyday life.

If you need to reach me, please use the Contact page.
